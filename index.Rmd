# Preamble

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "png", dev.args = list(type = "cairo-png"),
                      fig.align='center', cache = TRUE,tidy=TRUE)
```

Here we write some small text. 

The book is an extension of the original paper [@SlaterEtAl_HydroR] in which the history that lead to the increased interest in R from the hydrological community is briefly outlined. 


```{r echo=FALSE}
# if we want a date date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
